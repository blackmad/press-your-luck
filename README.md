# Press Your Luck

A version of the popular game show using CSS Sprites + Javascript.

Bugs I need to fix:

- Multiple clicks on the start button will fire the event handler exponentially
- I have a barely visable message appear over the logo once 3 whammys have been hit, but I need to freeze, restart the game.
- I want the spins counter to update as soon as the board stops not after it's restarted.
